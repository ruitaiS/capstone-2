#object_id is I think the records for the same car / owner

#--------

# Number of seats (sports cars = more liability?)

# Years without accident (safer drivers = lower payout?)

# Type of vehicle (commercial drivers better?)

# Tonnage (heavy = driven by pros, thus safer? or will they cause more damage?)

# Age of vehicle (older = more problems?)

# Age of policy (longer = better?)

# Insured value (more expensive = more careful drivers? or more claims paid?)

# Consider looking at how they do this irl
