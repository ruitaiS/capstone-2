Movielens Project:

an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed
a methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, insights gained, and your modeling approach
a results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance
a conclusion section that gives a brief summary of the report, its limitations and future work

0 points: The report is either not uploaded or contains very minimal information AND/OR the report is not written in English AND/OR the report appears to violate the edX Honor Code.
10 points: Multiple required sections of the report are missing.
15 points: The methods/analysis or the results section of the report is missing or missing significant supporting details. Other sections of the report are present.
20 points: The introduction/overview or the conclusion section of the report is missing, not well-presented or not consistent with the content.
20 points: The report includes all required sections, but the report is significantly difficult to follow or missing supporting detail in multiple sections.
25 points: The report includes all required sections, but the report is difficult to follow or missing supporting detail in one section.
25 points: The report is otherwise well-written, but is based on code that simply copies from previous code in the course series without further developing it.
30 points: The report includes all required sections and is well-drafted and easy to follow, but with minor flaws in multiple sections.
35 points: The report includes all required sections and is easy to follow, but with minor flaws in one section.

Vehicle Insurance Project:

An introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and variables, and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed.
A methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, any insights gained, and your modeling approach. At least two different models or algorithms must be used, with at least one being more advanced than linear or logistic regression for prediction problems.
A results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance.
A conclusion section that gives a brief summary of the report, its potential impact, its limitations, and future work.
A references section that lists sources for datasets and/or other resources used, if applicable.

0 points: The report is either not uploaded or contains very minimal information AND/OR the report is not written in English AND/OR the report appears to violate the terms of the edX Honor Code.
